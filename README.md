### Course Overview

This course provides an overview of experimental design and analysis from the perspective of
the general linear modeling framework. Topics include theory of experimental design, single and multiple factor experiments, between-subject and within-subject designs, factorial and nested designs, random effects, analysis of covariance, and blocking. The course includes lab time devoted to computer applications.

### Labs 
Below are the list of lab assignments and topics covered
* Lab 1: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) using GLM Framework 
* Lab 2: Measures of Effect, Association, and Assumptions for ANOVA]
* Lab 3: Pairwise and Complex Contrasts in One-Way ANOVA

### Sample Data Visualizations

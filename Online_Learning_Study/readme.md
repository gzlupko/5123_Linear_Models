### Project Overview

The data presented in this proposal were accessed from Alpert et al. (2016), a randomized study that examined the effect of different classroom instructional mediums on learning outcomes of college students. In particular, Alpert et al. (2016) examined the effect of three different course formats (e.g. face-to-face, hybrid, and purely online) on studentsâ€™ cumulative final grade in a university-level economics class. The researchers found that student final grades were significantly different across traditional, hybrid, and purely online learning formats. Specifically, students in the online learning condition received final grades that were, on average, four to five points lower than students in the traditional, in-person lecture format after controlling for GPA, SAT scores, and student credit hours.

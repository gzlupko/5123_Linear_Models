```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(haven) 
setwd("~/Desktop/5123 Linear Models/Data Analysis Project/Potential Data Sets/Online Learning") 
```


```{r}
learning <- read_dta("online_assessment.dta") 
head(learning) 
```






```{r}

# filter data set for only those that completed the course 
completed <- learning %>%
  filter(!falsexam == 0 & !is.na(gpa)) 


```




Test for covariate suitability 

Is GPA an appropriate covariate to be used in ANCOVA? 
```{r}

cor(completed$gpa, completed$falsexam)

lm(falsexam ~ gpa, data = completed) %>%
  summary()

ggplot(data = completed, aes(x = gpa, y = falsexam)) + geom_point() 
```

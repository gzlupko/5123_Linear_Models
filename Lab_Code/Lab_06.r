# 1. The Data

# The paper is called "Do Information Technologies Improve
#  Teenagersâ€™ Sexual Education? Evidence from a Randomized 
#  Evaluation in Colombia" and is available here:

# Download the data from 
# https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/H82SFI
# You will get a zip folder. Inside the folder, go to the subfolder called

# 2. Cleaning
###################
# The data are saved as a Stata data file (.dta). Need to use a package 
# such as haven to import it. Install the haven package with
# install.packages("haven"), then load it. 

library(haven)
library(tidyverse) 
dat <- read_dta("~/Dropbox/Teaching/Linear Models and Experimental Design/2021 SPRING/06 Mult Comp/Colombia_Sex_Ed.dta")
#dat <- read_dta(file.choose())
dat <- read_dta("Colombia_Sex_Ed.dta")  
dim(dat) # 1430 variables!

# There are a lot of variables here. We will only focus on the 
# categorical treatment status variable, called, "treatmentstatus" and
# the continuous outcome variable called, 
names(dat)

# The grep() function searches for a character pattern in x.
grep(pattern = "treatmentstatus", x = names(dat))

# The output from the grep() call above tells us that the 
# treatment status variable is the 798th variable in the data
# set.
table(dat$treatmentstatus)

# The file called "MainTables.do" contains the Stata code to 
# replicate the tables in the paper. The code for creating 
# Table 3 begins on line 125. There we see that the coded names
# for the outcome variables are know_std_prev, know_sexual_violence,
# know_std_prevmeth, know_preg_prev, know_condom_use, and know. These
# six variable names correspond with the outcomes presented in Table
# 3 in the World Bank paper.

# We will use the first variable, know_std_prev, which measures 
# knowledge of symptoms and causes of STIs. See Table 3 in the paper 
# for definitions.
# The argument value = TRUE will cause grep() to print the value 
# of the pattern match found instead of its position.
grep(pattern = "know_std_prev", x = names(dat), value = FALSE)
grep(pattern = "know_std_prev", x = names(dat), value = TRUE)

# This returns any patterns that *contain* the string "know_std_prev", 
# but we only want those that match the string *exactly*. One solution
# is to use regular expressions (https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf)
# to specify that the pattern should begin and end at the first and
# last characteres in our string. ^ specifies the start of a string and
# $ specifies the end. The strings we want, however, begin with r1_, r2_, 
# or r3_. Here, we can use the period to denote "any character".
grep(pattern = "^r._know_sexual_violence$", x = names(dat), value = TRUE)

# Ok, now that we know we have the three variables we need, let's get
# their positions.
grep(pattern = "^r._know_std_prev$", x = names(dat), value = FALSE)

# r1, r2, and r3 represent the different time points at which data
# was collected. r1 is baseline, r2 is one week after intervention, 
# and r3 is six months after intervention.

# Here we will examine the efficacy of the intervention at one
# week after it was administered (i.e., we will use r2 as outcome).

# First, let's create a data set that only contains the variables we
# need.

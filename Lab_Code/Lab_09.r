# Tasks for lab
#######
# 1. Create a plot of baseline chronicity on the x-axis vs
#    1 year severity rating (pk5) on the y-axis. (with good
#    labeling; no need to include regression lines, and 
#     no need to include legend but feel free in ggplot2) 

# 2. Report on baseline balance via Cohen's d and the variance 
#    ratio for the chronicity variable. Was the variable 
#    sufficiently balanced at baseline or are you concerned
#    that it is imbalanced? Why?

# 3. Does baseline chronicity seem an appropriate choice
#    for an ANCOVA covariate? Support your answer by discussing
#    the strength of it's linear relationship with the outcome and
#    whether there is evidence that it interacts with treatment.
#    specifically, address the ANCOVA-specific conditions listed here

# 4. No matter what you conlcluded above, run the ANCOVA using
#    chronicity as baseline covariate and report your results
#    in context. I.e., was the acupuncture treatment effective 
#    or not and by how much?

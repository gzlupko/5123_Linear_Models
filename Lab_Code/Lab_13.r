# Here we will work through Exercise 17 in MDK (p. 660)

# A developmental psychologist is interested in the role 
# of the sound of a motherâ€™s heartbeat in the growth of 
# newborn babies. Fourteen babies were placed in a nursery 
# where they were constantly exposed to a rhythmic heartbeat 
# sound piped in over the PA system. Infants were weighed 
# at the same time of day for 4 consecutive days, yielding 
# the following data (weight is measured in ounces):
library(AMCP)
data("C11E17")
dat <- C11E17
dat

# These data are in wide format. As a first step, we need to
# practice going back and forth from wide to long format.

# Add an id number

# Transform to long format

                            values_to = "Weight") # name of the stacked variable
